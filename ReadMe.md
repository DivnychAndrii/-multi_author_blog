Second web application created by me, in help with course notes
This is fully functional blog where multiple authors can post their content.

For this point, I was mainly focused on the server part of the app and used some ready design code from Bootstrap
Technologies that were used:

Flask(Migrate, Login, Forms, Blueprints, Werkzeug)

SQLite as a database, using SQLAlchemy

HTML5, Jinja2

Since there was already created solution from bootstrap, my next step will be to do the Front-End stuff from scratch
Particularly fixing some bugs, adding a lot more functionality, API, security, a lot more options and of course deploying it to the web.

Adding Design view to log in page. Whole website will be in such design and I would like to implement through CSS+JS
