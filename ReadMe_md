Second web application created by me, in help with course notes
This is fully fuctional blog where multiple authors can post their content
For this point, I was mainly focused on the server part of the app and used some ready design code from Bootstrap
Technologies that were used:
Flask(Migrate, Login, Forms,Blueprints, Werkzeug)
SQLite as a database, using SQLAlchemy
HTML, Jinja2
Since there was already created solution from bootstrap, my next step will be to do the Front-End stuff from scratch
As well as fixing some bugs, adding a lot more fuctionallity, API,security, 
a lot more options and of course deploying it to the web. 
Already happy for such a result!
